* feat: Add Mac OS X M1 prebuild for Node.js 16.13.1. Pull request [302](https://github.com/yfinkelstein/node-zookeeper/pull/302) by @davidvujic
* fix: node-gyp is already included in npm. Pull request [301](https://github.com/yfinkelstein/node-zookeeper/pull/301) by @davidvujic
* fix: replace lodash with vanilla js, remove unused dependencies, remove unnecessary usage of t.plan() in Ava tests.

    __NOTE:__

    the `_.defaults` lodash function is replaced with `Object.assign` (with `src` and `target` flipped) to have a similar behaviour as the lodash function.

    But it isn't 100% the same thing. If the original object has a key with an __undefined__ value, it will behave differently than with the lodash defaults fn.
